Herosaver
=========

Save Configuration and STL of https://www.heroforge.com/

Usage
-----

You can use HeroSaver in one of two fashions. Either you let it load as soon as you visit HeroForge (You need a browser extension for that), or you load it manually through your browsers console (No extension needed).

### Automatically

You can automatically load HeroSaver when you visit HeroForge by adding a GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey script. For that you need to install GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey (Click [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) for Firefox, or [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/) for Chrome, and install the addon).

after a script manager is installed click following link to add the script: 

<https://github.com/rovacado/StlSaver/raw/master/greasemonkey_autoload.user.js>

you are done.

*Note:* There is a version of TamperMonkey for Opera Next, Safari and Edge, but I never tried them. It is very much possible, that the same workflow works for those browsers.

### Manually

Alternatively you can load the HeroSaver manually everytime you visit HeroForge.

  1. Go to https://www.heroforge.com/
  2. Open the Javascript Console [F12], then click on Console
  3. Paste the following
  
```
var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest;xhr.open("get","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinipdiass/stlsaver/master/herosaver_test.js",true);xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){if(xhr.readyState==4){var script=document.createElement("script");script.type="text/javascript";script.text=xhr.responseText;document.body.appendChild(script)}};xhr.send(null);
```


### Buttons

Once HeroSaver is loaded, you have these additional buttons on the top bar: 

* Export Model (STL) - Exports the current model and downloads a STL of it.
* Export (JSON) - Exports the current model settings in a JSON format.
* Import (JSON) - Imports a previously exported JSON file with model settings.

Limitations
-----------

Some details of the figures are implemented via shaders. These are not exported :( This is also the reason, the exported figures look a bit _blocky_. If you want hight quality exports, consider purchasing the stl files from heroforge :)
